// route) it follows, the ROUTINE (schedule) it runs on, and the APPS it talks
// to.
//
// Two hosts feed this page:
//   - Vercel: the crons in vercel.json. Their schedules are read LIVE from that
//     file (the source of truth), so a schedule change there shows here with no
//     edit; the human-facing metadata (what each reads, which apps it touches)
//     is enriched below by cron path. A cron with no enrichment still renders,
//     flagged, rather than being silently dropped.
//   - Local: Claude Desktop scheduled-tasks captured from ~/.claude/scheduled-
//     tasks. These are a snapshot (see CAPTURE below), not a live read: a page
//     deployed on Vercel cannot read a personal machine's filesystem at request
//     time.
//
// Policy: routines belong on the Mac mini, never on a laptop. Any routine whose
// observed host is a laptop is a violation and is surfaced as such.
